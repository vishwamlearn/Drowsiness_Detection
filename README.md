# Drowsiness_Detection
##### Fine Tuning  Pretrained Efficient Net model from Keras CV Image classifiers model to detect drowsiness on Kaggle Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ismailnasri20/driver-drowsiness-dataset-ddd).
->Used Transfer learning with base model as Efficient Net (Drowsiness_Detection_efficient_net.ipynb) to train drowsiness model, saved model and used it to predict live drowsiness based upon face detection using openCV
